//Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1,
//the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.
//
//You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people.
//Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1,
//and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.
