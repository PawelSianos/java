//Given a sequence of integers as an array,
//determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence
//by removing no more than one element from the array.

//For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
//almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
//There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

//For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
//almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.
//You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2].
//Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
