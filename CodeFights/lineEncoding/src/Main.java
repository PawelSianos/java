/**
 Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

 First, the string is divided into the least possible number
 of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
 for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
 Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced
 with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character

 for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
 Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the
 same order and a new string is returned.
