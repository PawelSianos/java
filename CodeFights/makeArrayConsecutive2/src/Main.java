// Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday,
// each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect,
// he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1.
// He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that.
// Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

//    For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
//    makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.
//    Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.
